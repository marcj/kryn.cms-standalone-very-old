Kryn.cms
========

A enterprise open-source Content-Management-System and Content-Management-Framework with a full RESTful API
written in PHP and JavaScript using Symfony Components, Propel, Mootools and other rock-solid libraries.

We're in development. This means, there are still a _lot_ of issues in this product (not even an Alpha) and it's not everything implemented yet.
__So, please do not install or use it, yet. Most things don't work.__

PHPUnit
--------

 You have several environment variables to adjust the config in the test suite.

    HOST       The domain the installation (should) have. Default is `127.0.0.1:8000`.
    DB_NAME    The database name. Default is `test`
    DB_USER    The database username. Default is `root`
    DB_PW      The database password. Default is empty.
    DB_TYPE    The database type. `mysql`, `pgsql`, `sqlite`, `sqlsrv`. Default is `mysql`.
    DB_SERVER  The database server address. Default is `127.0.0.1`. For sqlite the file path.
    NOINSTALL  Defines whether the bootstrap removes the config file or not. `1` or `0`. Default is `0`
    TEMP       Defines a other temp folder. E.g. `app/cache` or `/tmp/`. Default is 'app/cache'.

Examples:

    ./phpunit.phar
    HOST=dev.local ./phpunit.phar
    DB_USER=kryn DB_PW='@#$TKKAFS' ./phpunit.phar test/Tests/Object/ApiTest.php
    NOINSTALL=1 TEMP=/tmp/ php54 vendor/phpunit/phpunit/phpunit.php --stop-on-failure tests/Tests/Core/ConfigTest.php
    DB_TYPE=sqlite DB_SERVER=test.sq3 php54 vendor/phpunit/phpunit/phpunit.php

The test suite installs automatically Kryn.cms with the configuration above if `./app/config/config.xml` does not exist
and if NOINSTALL=0. Don't forget to run `composer install` first.

For SQLite tests you should run `touch test.sq3; chmod 777 test.sq3` first.
